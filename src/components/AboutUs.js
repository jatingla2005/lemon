          <h2>Little Lemon,</h2>
          <h3>Chicago</h3>
          <p>
            Founded by college friends Jamal and Elena, Little Lemon began as a weekend pop-up
            in Chicagoâ€™s farmer's markets. Their passion for Mediterranean flavors and seasonal
            ingredients gained a loyal following. What started as a tiny booth is now a bustling
            restaurant, where dishes are inspired by Greek, Lebanese, and Turkish family recipes.
            The heart of the kitchen is community, freshness, and a zest for bold flavors.
